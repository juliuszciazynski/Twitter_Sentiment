Twitter Sentiment Analysis\
Overview\
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project aims to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of tweets using natural language processing techniques. It analyzes around 1.6 million tweets and provides insights into the sentiment of the Twitter user base.

The project serves various purposes, including:
Providing insights for researchers studying public opinion trends on social media platforms.

Dataset\
The dataset used contains 1.6 million tweets, each labeled with its sentiment (positive or negative). It includes tweet text along with other metadata such as user ID and date of creation.

Preprocessing\
Data pre-preprocessing: Remove unnecessary columns and standardize sentiment labels.\
Natural language processing: Remove stopwords and perform lemmatization to prepare text data for analysis.

Models Used\
Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer: A traditional machine learning approach using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.\
Naive Bayes with TF-IDF Vectorizer: Another traditional machine learning approach using TF-IDF vectorization.\
Logistic Regression with Word2Vec: Utilizing pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings for feature representation.\
Logistic Regression with GloVe: Utilizing pre-trained GloVe embeddings for feature representation.\
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network: A deep learning approach using LSTM for sequential data processing.\
Evaluation\
The accuracy of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. Results are compared to determine the most effective approach for sentiment analysis.

Future Work\
Explore additional deep learning architectures for improved sentiment analysis.\
Incorporate more sophisticated text preprocessing techniques.
